It’s been self-evident for a while that we’ve stepped into a remarkable moment in history. It reminds me of the late ’90s, the early Internet days, only grander, more electrifying, and a little frightening. I’ve decided to pour most of my time into the problem of intelligence, not the AGI, ASI, and other acronym-laden milestones the big labs chase, but the nature of intelligence that exists outside the human brain and where we stand in relation to it. We’ve been iterating since the ’60s, yet we’re still hemmed in by last-century constraints. Technology should feel more social, more human. I want to figure out what that looks like.
